This repo is for testing OOD detector with Early Exits models, the dependency is the same as OPENOOD project, please install openood first from this link https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD
To run the code in Knn OOD-test resnet-with faiss-completed.ipynb. You can download the resnet18 model trained with cifar4 dataset here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABksP6dNWaO1x24SYUx3ygjNK_wUSniA/view?usp=sharing, and manually split the cifar10 dataset into cifar4(the first 4 classes of cifar10) and cifar6b(the rest 6 classes of cifar10).
